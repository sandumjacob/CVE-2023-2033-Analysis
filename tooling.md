# V8
## VM Setup
I needed to create a Jammy Jellyfish VM for the research. This is because v8 only supports the following.

./build/install-build-deps.sh: line 115: --unsupported: command not found
WARNING: The following distributions are supported,
    but distributions not in the list below can also try to install
    dependencies by passing the  parameter
 	Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic with EoL April 2028)
 	Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal with EoL April 2030)
 	Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy with EoL April 2032)
 	Debian 10 (buster) or later

## Debugging
Build v8 debug to get d8 with debug symbols.
```
python3 gm.py x64.debug
autoninja -C out/x64.debug d8
```
